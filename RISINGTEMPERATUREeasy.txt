# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT w1.id 
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate + INTERVAL 1 DAY 
AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

or 

//LAG IS NOT SUPPORTED in leetcode but is another alternative way for it in MySQL

SELECT id 
FROM Weather 
WHERE temperature > LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate);
